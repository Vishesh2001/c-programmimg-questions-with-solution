    A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.

    The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

    The general form of a function is:

    return_type function_name([ arg1_type arg1_name, ... ])
     { code }    


    concept of call stack.
    a stack of functions is mainted in the memory such that.
    when a fuction is called its stack frame is pushed on the top of the call stack.
    and when the function returns, its stackframe is popped out of the cll stack.

    stack frame is the memory int the form stack which has the function code, local variables, return values.,etc.
